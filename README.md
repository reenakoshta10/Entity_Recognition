## Description
Our manager at a consultancy agency has been overrun by an influx of projects that involve large volumes of financial news. He hands you piles and piles of documents and asks you to read each one and provide a summary of: 

**Who is implicated in this document? and what are their relationships?**

**How hard could that be? Not that hard, no ?** True. If you know, natural language processing that is. You realize that what your manager really wants, is a knowledge graph.
